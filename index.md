The Brazilian ICPC Summer School 2017 is organized by the [Brazilian Computing Society](http://www.sbc.org.br) be hosted by [Unicamp](http://www.unicamp.br) during two weeks from January 23rd to February 4th. Our main goal is to train [ICPC](http://acm.baylor.edu) World Finalists. We are also opening extra slots for Latin American students who want to improve their problem-solving skills for the next competitions. We are inviting former World Finalists as instructors, and we intend to record all lectures.

This edition will include lectures from Monday to Saturday. Each week will have one day dedicated to our sponsors. The full schedule will be released soon. We intend to live stream all classes and allow students to compete remotely.

All interested students should register individually through our online system. If you have a team, all three members should register individually. The registration fee will cover food expenses. World Finalists and Brazilian Medalists are exempt from the registration fee.

Our basic schedule will have theory classes in the mornings and contests in the afternoons. Each instructor will select classes and contest contents.
