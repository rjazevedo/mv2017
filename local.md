## How to arrive in Campinas?

Our nearest airport is Viracopos (VCP), served by the following airlines: Azul, TAM, Gol, e Avianca. There is a direct bus line from the airport to downtown and central bus station managed by [LiraBus](http://www.lirabus.com.br) (previously Caprioli), or you can take the city bus line 193 to the central bus terminal and bus 330 to Unicamp. A taxi from the airport to Unicamp will cost around R$120,00. We also have Uber in Campinas.

If you prefer flying to São Paulo, you can take a bus from [LiraBus](http://www.lirabus.com.br) (previously Caprioli) to Campinas bus station, and take a bus to Unicamp (332 and switch to 330).

If you arrive by bus, you can take the bus 330 to Unicamp.

## Housing

We recommend that you visit Morar Unicamp to select a place to stay and directly contact them. We do not cover housing expenses. We will provide local student contacts to the registered students so you can arrange cheaper places to stay.
